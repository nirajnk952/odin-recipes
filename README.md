# Odin Recipes Project

This project is a simple recipe website built using only HTML. It consists of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes an image of the dish, a description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

## Features

- **Main Page**: The main page (`index.html`) contains links to each of the recipe pages.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe page contains:
  - A title (`h1`) with the name of the dish.
  - An image of the dish.
  - A brief description of the recipe.
  - An unordered list of ingredients.
  - An ordered list of steps to prepare the dish.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the main page with links to the recipes.
3. Click on any recipe link to view the full recipe.
